# Slay the Spire Sensei

[Slay the Spire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slay_the_Spire), developed by [MegaCrit](https://www.megacrit.com/), is a roguelike video game combined with deck building elements. I was hooked when I played my first run and started to dig deeper into strategies and theory crafting soon after. As I am a strong believer in learning by applying, it didn't take long for me to start working on an engine that is able to play the fights perfectly, called the *Slay the Spire Sensei*. Implementing the mechanics on the one hand and studying the results on the other hand helped me tremendously to get stronger at this game.

Currently, the *Slay the Spire Sensei* is just an early Python prototype with terrible usability. In its current state it won't be beneficial to anyone except myself, so I won't release the code yet, but will do so when the project reaches a certain level of maturity.

In the meantime, I will share my insights here in the form of quizzes and corresponding articles explaining my findings. The quizzes will also be shared on the [Slay the Spire Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/). I hope you'll find my analyzes helpful and advance your strategies and tactics along the way.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dementophobia) to get updates on this little pet project of mine. I also invite you to check out some of my other publications here on GitHub, like my [Lessons in the fundamentals of artificial neural networks](https://github.com/Dementophobia/fundamentals-of-artificial-neural-networks/blob/master/README.md).
