# Deck: AN, PT, RC, FF, IM
## Analysis for turn limit 4
This was the only deck that broke the turn 4 limit analysis. With four card generating engines (Anger, Power Through, Reckless Charge and Immolate) it made the simulation tree so large, that the Sensei kept running into memory issues.

Because this deck has a lower win rate compared to many others until turn 3, and there is no indication that it will get a boost on later turns, I decided to accept it as a simulation breaker and skip the turn 4 analysis. Sorry Hubristank!
