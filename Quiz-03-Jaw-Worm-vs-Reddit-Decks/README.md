# Quiz #03: Jaw Worm vs. Reddit Decks

This is Quiz #03 from the [Slay the Spire Sensei series](../README.md#slay-the-spire-sensei). This quiz is different than the first two quizzes. Instead of asking specific questions and analyzing the results, I will give you a set of cards, which you will use to complete a deck. To participate in the quiz, you will have to post your deck on Reddit. I will analyze all of the submissions with the Slay the Spire Sensei in order to find the best proposed deck for the given situation.

You have 48 hours to submit your deck, starting from the moment the quiz went online. The winner will be announced on Reddit and the 3 best decks will be analyzed in the [solution](#solution) section.

If you have any questions or feedback, drop me a line on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dementophobia) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dementophobia81/).

### The Scenario

You are playing as [Ironclad](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Ironclad) against the [Jaw Worm](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Jaw_Worm) on **Ascension Level 7**. The Jaw Worm starts with **45/45 HP**. Your goal is to win the fight **without taking a single point of damage**! If this helps your imagination, you can assume you start the fight with a single HP (**1/80 HP**). [Burning Blood](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Blood) won't help you this time. You will start with the usual **3/3 Energy**. You don't have any relevant relics or potions.

Your deck will contain 10 cards. **3 Strikes**, **2 Blocks** and **5 cards of your choosing**.

Here is the pool of **25 cards**, which you can use to build your deck. You can **pick each card in the pool only once** and you must assemble a deck containing **exactly 10 cards**. You cannot remove the initial 5 basic cards.

Your goal is to assemble a deck that gives you the best chance to win the fight without taking damage. We'll assume that you play each hand perfectly, to optimize your chances of reaching that goal.

Last but not least, you are on a time limit. You could easily build a deck that is capable of staying alive indefinitely, if the Jaw Worm plays along. To avoid such scenarios, the time limit is set to 5 turns. If you cannot land the killing blow on turn 5, it counts as a loss. It's a fricking Jaw Worm after all. **Stalling forever is not an option!**

What will your deck look like? How can you optimize your chances for the perfect game? Let's get to work and post your results on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/cr4vcf/slay_the_spire_sensei_quiz_03_jaw_worm_vs_reddit/)!

### Solution

The three best decks assembled on Reddit will be analyzed in the solution section. The quiz is open on Reddit for 48 hours and the detailed deck analysis will take some time. You can expect the write-up to go online a few days after the quiz has ended.

Are you ready to take a peak or do you want to contemplate the challenge a little more before looking at other solutions?
